                    <h2>Fair Warning, We've been waiting for the third book since 2011</h2>
                        <p>Part of me almost doesn't want to recommend this series until it's finished, but I can't help myself in including it. The Name of the Wind, Wise Man's Fear, and the novella The Slow Regard of Silent Things are some of the most beautifully written books I've ever come across. They have some sort of unidentifiable rythym to them, and Pat's attention to detail and world building and possibly only second to the big man himself (J.R.R. Tolkien). 
                        </p>

                        <p>The frame story present in the books tells us that this story does not have a happy ending. Kvothe, a man who has become a myth, is telling his story to the Chronicler, and that story makes up the majority of the books. He starts with his late childhood, and the second book ends with him in his late teens. The third book is rumored to cover late teens to the present day, but Pat has been fairly tight-lipped about it.
                        </p>    
            
                        <p>Kvothe is a musician, and later learns to use sympathy, this world's version of magic. He has questionable and only sometimes consistent morals, is quick to anger. He kind of comes across as over-powered, but that strength has a good basis in the book. He's a very well-rounded character, and the side characters are also well written. I honestly am not sure what else I can say without giving away too much. This is another series where I would suggest not interacting with the fanbase until you've read the books to avoid spoilers(and their frustration). I would also save the novella until the end. It's a beautiful series, and it has much room for fan theory and speculation. The audio-book is also excellent, perfect for a really really long roadtrip.
