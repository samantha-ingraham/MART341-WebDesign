I recognize this is not an md file, and that I didn't demonstrate all the elements required in the new page purchase.html

However, I had been keeping track using notepad, and converting everything from txt to md seemed like a pain and not really neccesary for the assignment, so I hope this is acceptable.

While I could have used all of the elements in the purchase page, it would not have looked as clean as it does, and I feel like I was able to add a lot of consistency across my pages by spreading the usage out.

Div: primarily used to seperate groups of elements into distinct sections to allow for additional formatting
1. index.html - Line 13, 26, 42, 67
2. purchase.html - Line 14, 22, 34
3. suggestions.html - Line 12, 15, 18

Span: I used span to implement my css classes on specific parts of my html
1. index.html - Line 77, 78, 81, 82, 85, 86, 89, 90, 93, 94, 97, 98
2. suggestions.html - Line 22, 24, 26

Audio: used to create background noise, should the user want to listen to it. Credit to DailyJoy
1. index.html - Line 28
2. purchase.html - Line 24

Video: this tedtalk aligns with my views of fantasy. Fantasy has been used as a tool for thought since people first started telling stories,and this ted talk reflects that.
1. index.html - Line 44

Iframe: used for the youtube video, and for purchase windows into amazon for some of the books.
1. index.html - Line 44
2. purchase.html - Line 36, 38, 40, 42, 44

Class: Class is used in every place that span is used. Allowed me to add in my own, individual emphasis for certain kinds of content
1.design.css - Line 74, 79

Escape character: I decided to change my block quote and include these to demonstrate that I understood how to use them. I also actually needed one in the purchase page to ensure the heading displayed correctly.
1. index.html - Line 38, 39
2. purchase.html - Line 20
