<h1> Muh website ideas</h1>

<h3> books</h3>
<p>
    One idea for a website would be a catalouge of books I've read. I could include a description, dnf status, what parts I enjoyed and any criticism I might have, and what manner I consumed the book in. I could include what other works the author has done and if I have read them, link to the page containing their review as well. I could include images of the cover as well as a link to buy a physical copy, e-book copy, or audiobook copy. If audiobook, I could also review whether or not I enjoyed the audiobook reader. I could also include fan theories.

<h3>3d printer things</h3>
<p>
    A second idea for a website could be a repository of all the things my partner has created for his 3d printer. I could include the images of all of them that he has printed, and maybe have multiple pages linked to eachother based off what kind of item it is. I could include the link to their etsy, and their instagram, and maybe a video of something being printed.

<h3>gardening</h3>
<p>
    A third idea for a website is a more simple one, of all the gardening things I have learned. I could include pictures from my beekeeping lesson, as well as images of my garden. I could include a link for garden city harvest to show off their community garden program. I could include a link to the cornell cooperative extension website for the master gardener program. I could list out the kinds of things I've grown, how I have modified the soil, <br /> <b>and my successes and failures in growing stuff.</b>
