<h1> Why Books, Bongs, and botany?</h1>

<h3> Books</h3>
<p> I'd like to do a website about books because, well... <br>
<b>I enjoy them.</b><br>
and I have a ton of <s>shit</s> stuff to say about them. I am endlessly talking my partners ear off about my theories from the books I read. How they connect to life, how they connect to me, to how I view the world. As well as my run of the mill opinions on what's going to happen next, if the series is unfinished.

<h3> Bongs</h3>
<p> I'd like to do a website about my partners stuff because I think it's pretty cool. They are so creative, and very good at making something out of nothing. I think his work could use a little more celebration. So basically, I want to brag about how creative and talented he is.</p>

<h3> Botony</h3>
<p> maybe botany isn't the best description, but I had to keep the alliteration going. I think going through my gardening experience and really taking stock of what I've learned would be helpful to me. I also think highlighting garden city harvest is worth the effort, because they do so much good in the missoula area. </p>
