    <p>Welcome to my bookshelf. Here I will be reviewing my recent reads, distant reads, maybe even some book to movie/tv adaptations. I'll include a rating Super Spicy if the book contains graphic scenes, or just Spicy for books that have sex, but it's not smut. Any other content warnings will be case by case. <br><strong>Now, onto the good stuff</strong></p>

    <h3>The Faves</h3>
    <p>These are the books that I will always recommend to anyone who asks. They are the books that I will reread over and over again. They are the books that I will always have a copy of on my shelf, digital or otherwise. These are the books I read when I want to lose myself in the pages.<br><em> In no particular order....</em><br></p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="series/dresden.html" target="_blank">The Dresden Files</a></li>
        <li><a href="series/kingkiller.html" target="_blank">The King Killer Chronicles</a></li>
        <li><a href="series/scholomance.html" target="_blank">The Scholomance</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Okay, I recognize those are actually series and not individual books. Ideally, I'll review each book in the series on its own, but first I'll review them as a series all put together.</p>

    <!-- Todo items/goals: -->
    <!-- Landing page w links to each book, starting with current read -->
    <!-- Current read -->
    <!-- Dresden files -->
    <!-- King Killer Chronicles -->
