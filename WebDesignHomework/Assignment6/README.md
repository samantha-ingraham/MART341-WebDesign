**Website Idea I think I'll develop further**
*Book reviews*
I think this is the idea I'll be able to get the most joy out of. It will probably end up being kind of wordy rather than visually appealing, but I still think it will be fun.


I tried to adjust the width so it gave the image plenty of room but still felt like it was balanced with the image. I also changed the background color to sort of match the image and make it all feel cohesive.
I think I more had a like, idea of what kind of pages there would be rather than what those pages would look like. I did have to tinker a lot to get it just how i wanted it.
It was fairly easy to incorporate float and margin, and gave me a lot more control over the elements I had on the pages.
I've used css and html a bit before, albeit not extensively, so it wasn't entirely new to me and I think that made any challenges I faced more on the side of "Should I do 7% or 6% here?" instead of being some frustrating I've-never-seen-this-what-am-I-doing struggle.

I was moving this week, which made everything a pain in the butt, but thankfully I'm in the new place now so I should get caught up soon!
