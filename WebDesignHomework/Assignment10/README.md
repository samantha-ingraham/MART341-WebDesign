# Page I'll be working on: dresden.html

**Conveniently, I have already been using an external CSS style sheet**

class selector: used to move styling out of html files for better maintainability and adjustability and readability. Having all (or most) of the styling in one place prevents me from having to search for it constantly in my own code, and adjust multiple items at once in a uniform way
1. dresden.html line 
2. purchase.html line 16, 24, 33
3. index.html line 28, 45, 50
4. suggestions.html line 14, 31, 35, 39

ID selector: used to move styling out of html files for better maintainability and adjustability
1. dresden.html- i ended up really only using classes for this file
2. purchase.html line 22, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43 (iframe boxes and audio block)
3. index.html line 26, 47 ( navigation, audio block, youtube video)
4. suggestions.html line 28, 30, 34, 38


Different background colors
1. in dresden.html i use a different background for the overall page and the nav window(applied to all pages, however.)
2. i use different background colors for individual sections of the review in dresden.html

Different font colors
**all fonts, to include links, are a different color than their original and are handled in the css**

Opacity
1. for index and dresden nav bars, the border is opaque. 
2. hovering over the image in dresden.html causes it to go opaque, displaying the words "behind" it

Position
1. had to use this for the image in dresden so it would stay the heck put and not try and accomodate the words

Borders
1. borders are used on nav bars for index and dresden
2. i also applied a border radius to the image and review sections boxes so the corners would be curved.
