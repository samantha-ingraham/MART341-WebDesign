#assignment practice with md
#### this README file is for helping me practice using md

Mostly this week I have been tinkering with github desktop, and how to use it to transfer things between two computers. My newer/better computer is **heavy** ~~as hell~~, so I don't want to carry it to and from school. I'm *hoping* to have only vscode and github desktop installed on my lighter computer by the end of this semester.

This is a paragraph to show that I understand how they work. There must be a line in between in order to show a new paragraph, a simple return won't manage it.

Some goals I have for this semester are:
1. Moving into my partner and I's new place
2. Successfully using github desktop to easily push and pull info between my computers.
3. Getting comfortable with java
