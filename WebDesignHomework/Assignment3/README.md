#assignment practice with md
#### this README file is for helping me practice using md

This week we worked on how to upload entire directories from vsc to github, as well as working on **using markdown**. ~~it's nice~~ it's helpful that vscode changes the *markdown* text within the app to deliniate what you are doing. It makes it easier to use.

This is a paragraph to show that I understand how they work. There must be a line in between in order to show a new paragraph, a simple return won't manage it.

Some goals I have for this semester are:
1. Moving into my partner and I's new place
2. Successfully using github desktop to easily push and pull info between my computers.
3. Getting comfortable with java
