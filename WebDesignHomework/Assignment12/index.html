                Welcome to my bookshelf. Here I will be reviewing my recent reads, distant reads, maybe even some book to movie/tv adaptations. I'll include a rating Spicy if the book could be considered to have parts with erotic writing. I'll include M if sex happens in the book, but it isn't erotic writing. Any other content warnings will be case by case.

                These are the books that I will always recommend to anyone who asks. They are the books that I will reread over and over again. They are the books that I will always have a copy of on my shelf, digital or otherwise. These are the books I read when I want to lose myself in the pages.<br><em> In no particular order....</em><br>

            <p>
                Okay, I recognize those are actually series and not individual books. Ideally, I'll review each book in the series on its own, but first I'll review them as a series all put together.
