                The Dresden Files is a rather long (17 books in the main series alone so far, and 25 total for the main series planned!) series about a wizard in the Chicago white pages named Harry Dresden. He runs a private investigation buisness using his magic, and frequently finds himself in a whole-ass mess, generally not of his own making. His inability to turn away from injustice or wrongdoing pits him up against many powerful enemies. Each book usually covers 2-4 days of Harry's life, frequently around halloween.

                While Butcher's original intent was to emulate the noir genre, Harry's journey takes him away from the chauvanistic and sexist undertones that are a major part of the genre. Personally I would classify the series as modern fantasy and mystery, since each book has some sort of "reveal" of who-dunnit or why-didit. While Harry never stops describing basically every woman he meets as a goddess suddenly walking the earth (and is sometimes maybe a bit slimy about it), he does generally recognize that each of the women he meets is capable, intelligent, and frequently dangerous. The balance Butcher is able to strike between making Harry view women in a slightly (or sometimes not so slightly) piggish way whilst still portraying each woman as a fully fleshed out character with their own wants and motivations is a skill I don't frequently see from a lot of writers.

                Each book is mostly capable of standing on it's own, with frequent reminders and explanations of things that are relevant to the story being told in that specfic book but that occurred or were described in another book. That being said, the series as a whole has truly fantastic character development, not just from Harry but from multiple side characters as well, and also has an over arching story line throughout the books that is foreshadowed and built-upon in almost every book(and short stories! but I would suggest reading them last or looking up a "when should i read the short stories" list so that you don't spoil anything for yourself). This over-all story is fraught with intrigue and theory building hints that make the fan community so enjoyable to participate in. I would suggest holding off on engaging with other fans online until you are caught up, and in fact the advice usuallly given by whomever recommended the series to you when you first start: avoid the subreddit until you're caught up.
